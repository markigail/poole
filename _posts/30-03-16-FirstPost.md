Today I am starting off with my blog about Neogeography with Open Streetmap and Open Source Software. Yet I am not determined where to head exactly. But my aim is, to collect knwoledge and insights for myself and others.

###About myself
My name is Markus Gail, Computer Science and Geography student in the 4th semester, based in Augsburg/Germany. I joined OpenStreetmap in late 2015. Currently I am an intern at Geofabrik in Karlsruhe, working mainly on Nominatim housenumber interpolation.
